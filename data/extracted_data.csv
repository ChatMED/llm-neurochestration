01.pdf,"A 60-year-old female presented with a progressive onset of paraesthesia and numbness affecting her hands and upper limbs over the past few months. Her initial serum B12 vita-min level was borderline and she was started on substitution therapy, which did not alleviate her symptoms. In the last couple of weeks, the patient reported further exacerbation of her symptoms in the hands and arms upon neck flexion. She also mentioned clumsiness during daily activities, and fine motor tasks became challenging. Blood investigations, includ-ing follow up serum B12 and folate levels, were within normal limits this time.Upon examination (refer to the diagram), the patient had a normal gait, and the Romberg’s test was negative. Cranial nerves (CN) were intact, and fundoscopy revealed normal optic discs, with normal eye movements. There was no motor weakness in the upper limbs, but reflexes were symmetrically increased. A positive Tinel’s sign was elicited on the left. Sensory examination demonstrated the absence of any sen-sory deficit to pinprick or light touch, and vibration sense was normal in both arms and hands. Motor examination of the legs revealed normal power (5/5), and sensory functions were intact, including thermoception and nociception, except for slightly reduced vibration sense. The reflexes in the legs were brisk. The patient did not have any sphincter dysfunction.","The clinical presentation of progressive paraesthesia and only minimal sensory deficits with associated hyperreflexia in the upper and lower limbs (but with normal motor functions, cranial nerves, and fundoscopy) can be suggestive of cervical myelopathy. Notably, the patient’s intact and increased reflexes make peripheral neuropathy less likely, and her lack of risk factors (only borderline B12 deficiency, no history of diabetes) further supports this. The presence of sensory symptoms in the hands also raises the possibility of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) (sensory symptoms are known to  dominate the clinical picture in early stages of CTS). The absence of prior neurological symptoms is not suggestive of a relapsing-remitting course. Importantly, the patient reports symptom exacerbation upon neck flexion, indicative of L’hermitte phenomenon, which is often associated with pro - cesses affecting the cervical spinal cord such as compressive cervical myelopathy or inflammation (including multiple sclerosis or transverse myelitis). The patient’s hyperreflexia as an upper motor neuron feature further suggests spinal cord involvement. Sphincter signs which would be expected in spinal lesion were absent here. Given these clinical find - ings, the patient warrants further investigation, including MRI of the cervical spine, to confirm the diagnosis and guide subsequent management. MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine was also performed (Figs.  1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4).

As evidenced by the MRI images above, there were multiple T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions perpendicu - lar to the corpus callosum on the right side (Fig.  1.4). Additionally, a focus of high signal was detected in the spinal cord at the C2 level, affecting both the dorsal and central parts of the cord (Figs.  1.1 and 1.3). Similar lesions were observed at the T3/T4 level, located posterior to the central canal, as well as at the T10 level (Fig.  1.2). These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of multiple sclero - sis. The diagnosis was further supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis, which showed positive oligoclonal bands and increased lymphocytes.Answers 6 Keywords  Lhermitte’s phenomenon · Myelopathy · Multiples sclerosis","As the lesions in the spinal cord are located predominantly in the dorsal region, it is expected that sensory dysfunction would be more prominent than motor dysfunction. The dor - sal columns, responsible for proprioception, vibration sense, and fine touch, would be affected, while spinothalamic tract function, responsible for thermoception and pain, would be preserved due to its more ventral position. Objective examination revealed reduced vibration sense in the patient’s legs and the patient reported difficulties with gen - tle motor tasks (fine touch), both of which are consistent with dorsal column involvement. It is worth noting that the patient’s age does not fit the typical onset age for multiple sclerosis in females, which is around 31 years of age.","Grytten N, Aarseth JH, Lunde HMB, Myhr KM.

02.pdf,"A 69-year-old female with a history of rectal adenocarcinoma 7 years ago and subsequent surgery, radiotherapy and chemo-therapy presented with complaints of numbness, pins and needles, and weakness in both legs. There was longstanding lymphoedema in both legs (consequence of previous treat-ment). These symptoms were so severe that they caused fre-quent falls. The patient reported that her current symptoms began with foot drop on the left 2 months ago, and later pro-gressed to plantar flexion weakness (at the time of examina-tion, she was unable to move her left ankle properly). There was also discomfort in her left leg, including her big toe (numb-ness, pins and needles). Despite using an ankle splint, she was walking slowly and gait seemed antalgic (affected by pain).During the examination, the patient was found to be anae-mic, with a low haemoglobin level of 85 g/L (normal range: 110–146 g/L), and had thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 660 (normal range: 120–320). Additionally, there were border-line vitamin B12 and low folate levels.On neurological examination, there was an absence of tibial and peroneal motor functions (general ankle weakness) on the left side. Lymphoedema complicated the examination, but reflexes were absent in her left leg and present in her right leg. Plantars were negative. Findings in arms were within normal limits, and there were no signs of cranial nerves or cerebellar dysfunction. The patient reported intermittent uri-Chapter 2Anaemia, Pain and Ankle Weakness 10 nary and bowel incontinence, but this had been present since her surgery 7 years ago. There was hypoaesthesia (light touch, pinprick) in left leg not respecting any particular dermatome.","Overall, the patient’s symptoms, cancer history and even basic blood tests were concerning and required urgent investigation to determine the underlying cause. The patient’s presentation was highly suggestive of a peripheral neuropathy affecting the left leg. Patient presented with sensory dysfunction with a clear asymmetry in reflexes indicative of a lower motor neuron problem. The fact that the patient reported two separate phases of weakness, one affecting the peroneal nerve (foot Chapter 2.  Anaemia, Pain and Ankle Weakness 11 drop first) and the other the tibial nerve, suggests that two separate nerves may have been affected over time. It is important to note that the peroneal and tibial nerves both originate from the sciatic nerve (both are indeed branches of the sciatic nerve), which makes it likely that the underlying cause of the patient’s symptoms lies in this area. As such, nerve conduction studies (NCS) were conducted and revealed evidence of severe damage to both the left sci - atic and also obturator nerves. Further investigation is required to determine the underlying cause of the patient’s neuropathy. MRI of the sacral and lumbar spine, including an MRI of the pelvis, has been requested. This will provide a more detailed view of the affected nerve roots and may help to identify any underlying structural abnormalities or lesions (Figs.  2.1, 2.2, and 2.3).

Therefore, a comprehensive diagnostic approach is warranted, including a thorough history, physical examination, and appropriate imaging studies, in order to identify potential malignant causes of the neurological symp - toms.

03.pdf,"A 47-year-old male presented with left-sided facial paraesthe-sia (tingling) and facial spasms (twitching). The symptoms began 2  months ago, primarily affecting the left cheek. Initially, they were purely motor in nature without any sen-sory deficits, but within 2  weeks, sensory symptoms devel-oped. The patient did not experience any facial droop or speech impairment initially but he felt that his left side of his mouth was “droopy” now. He also reported left-sided dental pain. Prior to symptom onset, the patient experienced mild head trauma to the occipital region. Over time, the symptoms worsened in frequency, and at the time of examination spasms also involved the left side of the neck.The patient’s spasms responded to Carbamazepine MR 400  mg twice daily, prescribed by the general practitioner (GP). The patient subsequently developed paraesthesia (pins and needles) in the left hand.During the objective examination there was evidence of upper motor neuron facial nerve palsy on the left side, reduced light touch sensation (hypoesthesia) in the left tri-geminal area (all three divisions), and conductive hearing issues on the same side. A mild tremor in the left hand (high- frequency static) was also noted, but no obvious ataxia was observed. The remainder of the examination was within normal limits (extraocular muscles, lower extremities etc.).Chapter 3Twitching in the Face and Tingling 16","This patient presented with positive motor symptoms (facial twitches) and negative symptoms (facial drooping) associ - ated with the facial nerve. The motor deficit primarily affected the lower branches, indicating an upper motor neu - ron (UMN) issue, suggesting a contralateral hemisphere lesion. Additionally, there were negative (reduced sensa - tion) and positive (abnormal sensations) sensory symptoms in the left trigeminal area and in left hand. These findings suggest a cortical/subcortical process on the right side (contralateral).Chapter 3  Twitching in the Face and Tingling 17 Alternatively, it could indicate a left-sided (ipsilateral) brainstem involvement at the level of the Vth and VIIth nerve nuclei (although a lower motor neuron VIIth nerve palsy would be expected in that case—eyelid and forehead affected) and it would not necessarily explain hand involvement. The presence of facial twitching also raises the possibility of a focal motor seizure (Jacksonian seizure). The patient’s positive response to Carbamazepine, an antiepileptic drug, further supports this possibility. While functional hemifacial spasms should be considered, the involvement of at least two cranial nerves (Vth and VIIth) suggests an organic lesion rather than a functional cause. Therefore, an MRI scan was indicated to further inves - tigate the underlying pathology (Figs.  3.1 and 3.2).

MRI FLAIR, axial scan","The MRI revealed infiltration of the cortex in the posterior aspect of the right frontal lobe (Fig.  3.1). Additionally, a smaller lesion was observed in the left parieto-occipital region (Fig.  3.2). These findings were suggestive of a glioma. Biopsy/histology confirmed the diagnosis of a high-grade glioma, grade 4 (glioma multiforme/glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)). The patient’s clinical condition rapidly deteriorated, with the development of headaches and dysarthria. A follow-up CT scan performed 4  weeks later revealed a large area of decreased density (hypodensity) in the posterior frontal/pari - etal white matter on the left side, accompanied by surround - ing swelling (perifocal oedema) (see Fig.  3.3).

Initial presentation (focal motor seizures) was caused by the right frontal tumour infiltrating motor cortex. In retrospect tumour seemed to affect primary motor and premotor cortex (Brodman areas 4 and 6) and sensory symptoms were likely of cortical origin too (note the proximity of Brodman area 4, 6 (motor) and area 3 (sensory).Hallmarks 22 NotesFurther Reading Bruna J, Miró J, Velasco R.

04.pdf,"A 22-year-old male with a non-obese body habitus was referred to the neurology department due to persistent frontal headaches, which have been present for nearly a year. During the clinical evaluation, it became evident that he was experi-encing some additional symptoms. Over the past 6 months, he has been encountering balance issues. The onset of these bal-ance disturbances coincided with a severe chest infection and workplace stress. His balance has improved by the time of our examination and it reached its peak 3  months ago, during which he experienced difficulty walking in a straight line. His gait became noticeably unsteady, described by his wife as resembling “walking through the mud.” Notably, video footage from 3 months ago revealed features consistent with magnetic gait, indicating gait ataxia or apraxia. The patient has also reported falls, particularly on uneven surfaces. Furthermore, he described an inclination to walk in a stooped posture, espe-cially when fatigued. He also mentioned occasional involun-tary leg movements described as “kicking and shaking” while at rest. The patient also reported pulsating buzzing sensations in his ears and mentioned an isolated episode of urinary incon-tinence, which occurred several weeks ago.There was also family history of Parkinson’s disease (PD) on maternal side and patient suffered from mild action tremor since childhood.Chapter 4Unstable Gait, Headache and Increased Reflexes in a Young Man 24 On objective examination, the patient displayed normal cranial nerve function and cerebellar functions (finger-to-  nose testing, diadochokinesia). However, a minor action tremor was noted bilaterally. Reflexes were brisk and increased in all four extremities, and plantar reflexes were positive. Sensory func - tions, including vibration sense, were within normal limits. The patient demonstrated good muscle strength, generally rated at 5/5. His gait was broad-based with signs of gait ataxia, though it was notably better when compared to the video footage. The patient was able to perform squats and walk on his tiptoes and heels. While the tandem gait was relatively unstable, he man - aged it with unilateral support from the examiner. Sphincter functions were reported as normal recently, but there was one isolated episode of incontinence. Fundoscopic examination revealed bilateral papilloedema without the presence of haemorrhages. Chapter 4.  Unstable Gait, Headache… 25","We evaluated a patient who presented with chronic head - aches and a history of significant but improving focal neuro - logical symptoms. Initially, the clinical picture raised the possibility of a functional disorder triggered by exceptional circumstances, such as infection or stress. Notably, the sus - tained improvement in symptoms could support this option. However, it is essential to consider objective findings. These include positive plantar reflexes, hyperreflexia, and an uncommon episode of incontinence, which, given the patient’s age, suggests the potential involvement of the spinal cord. Another plausible scenario is that the patient had previ - ously suffered from encephalitis/menigitis, either of infectious or autoimmune origin, and is now experiencing a gradual recovery from this initial insult that occurred 6 months ago. Considering the patient’s age, demyelination or multiple sclerosis is a relevant consideration, with the pattern of improvement potentially indicative of a relapsing-remitting disease course. The observed clinical findings, such as papilloedema, incontinence, and hyperreflexia, are also seen in conditions associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP), such as space-occupying lesions or hydrocephalus. However, it’s important to note that the ongoing clinical improvement is atypical for such conditions. Benign or idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) (also known as pseudotumor cerebri) seems unlikely given the presence of focal neurologic symptoms and the absence of specific risk factors. Rare conditions like sarcoidosis or brain vasculitis are less likely but should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Although combined mixed degeneration can manifest with gait and sensory ataxia, this diagnosis is less likely due to the normal sensory exam and the presence of upper motor neuron findings. A family history of movement disorders may be mislead - ing, as spontaneous improvement is not typical for genetic movement disorders.Thoughts 26 Pulsatile tinnitus, while occasionally associated with increased ICP , is more commonly observed in the context of arteriovenous malformations (A VM) and vascular fistulas. To conclude the diagnosis and assess the extent of brain involvement, an MRI of the brain, cervical, and thoracic spine was requested. Routine blood tests, including assessments of hematinics and vasculitis screens, have also been conducted as part of the diagnostic evaluation (Figs.  4.1 and 4.2).

The conclusion drawn from these findings was that the most likely cause was a cavernoma with recent bleeding, which was compressing the aqueduct and resulting in triventricular hydrocephalus. As a result, the patient was promptly referred to the neurosurgery depart - ment for an endoscopic ventriculostomy, and the clinical response to this intervention was notably favourable (Fig.  4.3).

Keywords  Gait apraxia/ataxia · Headaches · Incontinence Cavernoma · Hydrocephalus","In this clinical case, we encountered a complex presentation that initially suggested increased intracranial pressure. However, the diagnostic journey was complicated by several confounding factors, including the presence of a longstanding mild tremor, a family history of movement disorders, the patient’s young age, and unexpected spontaneous improve - ment in symptoms (linked to intermittently oscillating ICP as aqueduct obstruction was incomplete). The underlying issue was found to be a cavernoma, a seemingly benign lesion that had the potential to evolve into a serious, life-threatening problem over the long term.

05.pdf,"An 18-year-old man with a history of previous seizures, not currently on antiepileptic treatment, was brought to the hospital by ambulance after experiencing a seizure at his workplace, a furniture factory, where he served as an apprentice. On arrival, he was in a post-ictal state and had some head injury (see below) bruising around right flank, and thigh, likely due to the seizure. Approximately 45 min after the seizure, he remained confused, with limited verbal responses (yes/no), and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 13, primarily due to impaired verbal responses. He also sustained a head injury, tongue biting, and urinary incontinence during the seizure. There was evidence of bleeding from his left temple, but it appeared to have stopped (dry blood patch).Neurologically, he appeared intact with no signs of weakness, cerebellar dysfunction, or abnormal cranial nerves. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed right bun-dle branch block, and a complete blood count showed elevated white blood cells. He denied any alcohol or illicit drug use. Within 60  min of arriving at the Accident and Emergency (A&E) department, he had a second general-ized tonic-clonic seizure. His mental status improved within 4 hours but complained of a severe left-sided head-ache (9/10) that was new to him, along with persistent nausea and intermittent vomiting.Chapter 5Post-seizure Confusion and Head Injury 32","This case involves a young man with a past history of epilepsy who experienced a recurrent epileptic seizure. Although he appeared to recover adequately, the recovery process was relatively slow. Usually in asymptomatic patients with a low likelihood of seizures being caused by underlying brain issues, or in patients with known epilepsy a brain scan is unneces - sary. However, in this particular case, the patient exhibited symptoms that raised concerns about increased intracranial pressure. There was new onset headache, nausea and vomit - ing. As a result, a CT head scan was arranged in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) setting (Figs.  5.1 and 5.2).Chapter 5.

Subsequent X-ray imag - ing confirmed the presence of a nail in that location (Fig.  5.2). Additionally, there was a small collection of blood found both beneath the dura mater (subdural) and outside the dura mater (extra/epidural) in that area (Fig.  5.1). The patient was transferred to the neurosurgical ward where the nail was suc - cessfully removed. It was determined that the patient likely had been working with a nail gun prior to the seizure.

06.pdf,"An 80-year-old male was admitted with a 2-week history of sud-den instability, which he described as episodes of “being pulled backwards” . He also reported new nausea. The patient has recently been diagnosed with critical aortic valve stenosis and had a history of prostate cancer in remission for last 5 years (suprapubic catheter in situ). There were no orthostatic features accompanying his symptoms, and his medication has remained unchanged for the past 12 months. Prior to this admission, he lived independently without the need for caregivers. Although he had consumed a moderate amount of alcohol regularly in the past, he did not engage in excessive drinking.During the objective examination, the patient exhibited an unsteady gait and a bent posture. He was unable to get up from a chair due to weakness in both legs (4/5). Hypomimia (reduced facial expression) and bradykinesia (slowness of movement) were observed in the left arm and hand, although no static tremor or rigidity was seen. During finger-to-nose testing, intention tremor was observed. Reflexes were present but relatively reduced in the lower extremities, and positive plantar reflexes were noted. Reflexes in arms were brisk.Cognitively, the patient displayed slowness and emotional flat-ness, with delayed responses, limited use of words, and repetitive speech patterns. Family reported some longstanding cognitive slowing. Gait ataxia was present and gait was not shuffling in nature. The patient was not physically fit enough to undergo the Chapter 6Extrapyramidal, Cerebellar and Cognitive Symptoms in an Older Man 38 pull test or “push and release” test to assess postural stability. The ACE-III test score was 80 out of 100. The patient had a history of long-standing urinary retention with occasional overflow incon - tinence and chronic constipation. Evaluating the current sphinc - ter situation was challenging (suprapubic catheter). The patient denied any sensory symptoms, and sensory function appeared normal except for reduced vibration sense in both ankles.","This elderly patient presented with a complex array of symptoms. Many of the symptoms, such as cognitive slowing and bladder issues appear to be longstanding or potentially related to neuro - degenerative or age-related processes. Bladder issues could be associated with the history of prostate cancer. However, there are also new symptoms, including gait difficulties, bent posture, bilat - eral leg weakness (paraparesis) with positive plantars and Chapter 6.  Extrapyramidal, Cerebellar and Cognitive… 39 reduced reflexes, and left arm mobility/dexterity issues (bradyki - nesia). Intention tremor and gait ataxia can be also related to potential cerebellar process (cerebellar ataxia). Sensory deficit did not seem significant enough to cause sensory ataxia. While Parkinsonism of various origins (idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD), vascular, medication-induced, etc.) is a possibility, the relatively acute/subacute onset and the absence of recent medication changes make it less likely. Furthermore, the patient’s history of cancer adds another layer of complexity to the case. New onset nausea could be also suggestive of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Considering the symptoms and clinical findings, it is important to investigate other potential causes. One of the options is hydrocephalus, which could account for cognitive problems and paraparesis. Sphincter issues are difficult to interpret in the clinical context. Cervical myelopathy is another potential consideration, but it does not fully explain the cognitive, extrapyramidal and cerebellar symptoms observed.

This mass was causing obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow at the fourth ventricle, leading to the development of obstructive hydro - cephalus (Figs.  6.2 and 6.3). To manage the condition, the patient was treated with dexamethasone, which resulted in a noticeable improvement in clinical symptoms including cognition. The patient exhib - ited marked improvement in mobility and was able to mobi - lize independently following the treatment. Patient was subsequently referred to the neurosurgery department for consideration of a ventricular drain. Regrettably even after ventricular drain insertion and input from oncology the patient’s clinical status deteriorated and he succumbed to the illness within 2 months after the initial diagnosis.

Upon reflection, it becomes evident that the patient presented with signs indicative of obstructive hydrocephalus. These included rapidly progressing parapare - sis, cognitive decline, and sphincter dysfunction. As the pri - mary cause of hydrocephalus was a metastatis in the cerebellar hemisphere, we also observed cerebellar ataxia with intention tremor. Reflexes in legs would be expected to be increased in hydrocephalus, which was not a case here. However, the clini - cal picture was complicated by the presence of Parkinsonian signs (bradykinesia, hypomimia) and the use of an indwelling suprapubic catheter (this potentially masked incontinence). Resting tremor, or static tremor, is an extrapyramidal hall - mark and occurs at rest, whereas intention tremor is typically Hallmarks 42 associated with cerebellar lesions and is observed during purposeful movements. It is recognized that hydrocephalus, including both obstruc - tive and normal pressure hydrocephalus, can mimic certain parkinsonian syndromes. This highlights the need to consider hydrocephalus as a potential underlying cause when parkin - sonian features are observed, particularly in the presence of additional neurological symptoms and a history of cancer.","Molde K, Söderström L, Laurell K.

07.pdf,"An 18-year-old female with a history of chronic neck pain visited the neurology clinic. She complained of stiffness in her neck, which had been ongoing for a couple of years. Recently, she started experiencing progressively worsening unsteadi-ness on her feet over the past 2 months. A neurological examination conducted 2 months ago did not reveal any abnormalities, including finger-nose or a Romberg’s test. The patient reported intermittent double vision and blurred vision for the past 2 months, along with occipital headaches. The patient did not mention persistent headaches, only dis-comfort at the back of her head when coughing or sneezing.During the current examination, bilateral rough nystagmus of large amplitude with a rotational component was observed. This nystagmus was concluded to be gaze-evoked nystagmus (GEN). Patient reported double vision in lateral positions. The Weber test lateralized to the left, and a reduced Rinne test was noted on the right. Positive plantar responses were observed on the right side. The patient exhibited an unsteady ataxic gait with a widened base and an unstable Romberg test. Reflexes were increased throughout. The finger- nose test was normal. There were negative sensory symptoms (numbness and reduced pinprick sensation) on the right side (in the arm and upper torso without convincing sensory level).Chapter 7Unsteadiness and Stiff Neck in a Young Female 44","The clinical presentation suggests cerebellar involvement as evidenced by the leading symptoms, including gaze-evoked likely cerebellar nystagmus, intermittent diplopia, and a broad-based ataxic gait.

The asymmetry in hearing or abnormal tuning fork test results raises further questions suspicion of posterior fossa involvement, specifically sensorineural hear - ing loss on the right. In a young adult with this constellation of clinical symptoms, an inflammatory or demyelinating aeti - ology should be considered. However, the progressive nature of the symptoms warrants concern for a space-occupying lesion affecting the cerebellum and brainstem.

The presence of positive neurological signs in this case suggested the involvement of multiple functional systems, including sensory, motor and cerebellar pathways. Given the patient’s age, demyelination was initially a plau - sible option. In retrospect stiffness of her neck represented nuchal rigidity. Patient’s sensory symptoms were related to syringomyelia. Inexhaustible large amplitude gaze evoked nystagmus (in all or some directions) is typical for cerebellar dysfunction. Surgical intervention, involving ventricular drain insertion initially and posterior fossa decompression yielded remark - able results. Significantly, there was also visible improvement in syringomyelia. Obstructive hydrocephalus is a life- threatening condition. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate intervention, such as the insertion of a ventricular drain/shunt and decompression, are crucial in management of this condition.","Tam SKP , Chia J, Brodbelt A, Foroughi M.

08.pdf,"A 65-year-old woman was walking in the street when she experi-enced the onset of tingling sensations on the left side of her face, which she described as a pins and needles feeling. She also felt dizzy. Upon returning home, her symptoms resolved within 1  hour. T wo days later, she experienced the same symptoms again, but this time she also felt that her left side of the face was being pulled outwards. She compared this sensation to the feeling she had after receiving local anesthesia at the dentist. Additionally, she had difficulty properly sensing the application of lipstick. A day later, she noticed abnormal sensations and tingling in her left hand when holding objects. Due to these symptoms, she was admitted to the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department at the hospital. However, by the time of admission, the positive sensory symptoms had subsided. The patient had a history of monthly migraines with visual aura, characterized by kaleidoscope- like and fortification-like patterns. Upon further questioning, she revealed experiencing very similar symptoms in her right- sided extremities approximately 6 months ago.The patient had an unremarkable medical history, and she did not smoke. An urgent CT scan of her head did not reveal any abnormalities.Upon examination, most findings were within normal limits. Her pupils were normal, and there was no relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) observed. Fundoscopy showed normal optic discs. All other cranial nerves were intact, including facial Chapter 8Tingling in the Face 52 power. The only notable finding was decreased light touch sen - sation, specifically in the second and third branches of the left trigeminal nerve (V2, V3). Her upper and lower limbs exhibited normal tone, power, reflexes, coordination, and sensation.","At first glance, the patient’s minimal and intermittent symptoms are notable. In terms of the differential diagnosis, a vascular aeti - ology such as a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) should be considered. The patient’s age is appropriate for a vascular event; however, she does not have any other risk factors com - monly associated with vascular conditions (e.g., non-smoker, no family history or hypertension).

Tingling in the Face 53 toms were distributed in a hemi-pattern, affecting the left arm/ hand and the left side of her face, which could be consistent with a TIA occurring in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, however affecting only sensory functions (pure sensory stroke). Considering the patient’s history of migraines and the intermittent nature of her symptoms, complicated migraine could indeed be responsible. But persistent sensory deficit observed during examination in the trigeminal area suggests the presence of brain or brainstem pathology. To further investigate the possibility of a vascular aetiology; a vascular work-up was initiated, which included ultrasound of the carotid arteries, follow-up CT head with angiogram, and an echocardiogram. The results of these tests were reported as within acceptable limits, with only non-  specific small vessel changes observed on the CT scan. To gather more detailed information, an MRI was requested as an outpatient test. In the meantime, the patient was discharged on antiplatelet medi - cation, as a stroke prophylaxis (Figs.  8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4).

Additionally, the presence of T1 hypointense lesions (black holes) perpendicular to corpus callosum (see T1W images above) was observed (Fig.  8.4). A lumbar puncture was per - formed, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed lymphocytic oligocytosis and positive oligoclonal bands (OCB).

Upon discussing his condition with his fam-ily, it was revealed that he had been experiencing several other symptoms over the past week. These symptoms included headache, lethargy, occasional agitation, speech difficulties, and a general feeling of being unwell—he had been experi-encing flu-like symptoms for the past four weeks. Additionally, he complained of left-sided weakness.On objective examination, the patient appeared to still be in a post-ictal state, displaying slow responses but was able to communicate. Left-sided hemiparesis was observed, along with increased reflexes on the left side and positive plantar responses. The patient exhibited slurred speech (dysarthria) but maintained fluency with minor word-finding difficulties. Cranial nerves were normal, but finger-nose ataxia and bilat-eral dysdiadochokinesia were present. Unfortunately, shortly following admission, the patient experienced further seizure, necessitating transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). After the last seizure, the patient did not regain consciousness fully and had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 10 out of 15. Additionally, an increased temperature of 39.1  °C, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 287 , and a white blood cell (WBC) count of 18.9 with neutrophilia were noted.Chapter 9Generally Unwell Man 58","We saw a patient exhibiting a rapidly progressing neurologi - cal presentation, including a reduced level of consciousness and seizures in the context of feeling unwell systemically for several weeks.

Generally Unwell Man 59 However, it is important to consider that the infection markers may not be directly linked to the development of seizures and other focal neurological symptoms. In such cases (patients presenting with hemiparesis), a vascular cause such as an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke should be taken into consideration. Additionally, the onset of seizures could also be indicative of a space-occupying lesion (SOL). Toxic aetiol - ogy seemed less likely in this scenario. The initial step in the diagnostic process would be to arrange a brain scan, such as a CT scan, to evaluate for the presence of a space-occupying lesion or bleeding. Depending on the results of the CT scan, a lumbar puncture may be the subsequent course of action. Blood cultures have also been collected to aid in identifying any potential infectious aetiol - ogy (Figs.  9.1 and 9.2).

Vaccination efforts have shown significant improvement in pediatric populations. Pneumococcal meningitis often occurs in con - junction with a systemic infection, as seen in this case—with pneumonia. The fact that the Streptococcus strain in this case was broadly sensitive to antibiotics played a crucial role in the patient’s favourable recovery. Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics is vital in the management of bacterial meningitis, as the condition carries a mortality rate of approx - imately 25%. The presence of pneumocephalus, particularly in the pos - terior fossa and in close proximity to the mastoid, is a rare finding but can be indicative of meningitis/infection.

10.pdf,"A 50-year-old female, working as a social worker, presented to the outpatient clinic with a complaint of numbness on the left side of her tongue, which has persisted for 3 weeks. This symptom followed a severe chest infection that required hos-pitalization approximately 6  weeks ago. Although doctors suspected influenza as the cause of her illness, no formal PCR test was conducted. Over time, she noticed that the numbness spread to her left lip and the left side of her face, including the left side of her chin and around her eye. She denied any con-current headache, hearing loss, or facial weakness. She lik-ened the sensation to the numbing effect of local anaesthesia used during dental procedures.At the time of the neurology appointment, the patient reported feeling significantly better, with an estimated improvement of 80%. She mentioned experiencing ongoing improvement, particularly within the last 7 days.During the examination, the patient appeared well; her resting blood pressure was 151/90. Her medical history was unremarkable except for well-controlled hypothyroidism and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause. Upon further discussion of her symptoms, she described numbness in the periorbital region, cheeks, chin, and fore-head on the left side, indicating involvement of all three branches of the left trigeminal nerve (V1, V2, V3). There was a generalized absence of reflexes throughout the body, and Chapter 10Numbness of Face and Tongue 64 there was noticeable hypoesthesia (reduced sensitivity to light touch) in the left V1–V3 dermatomes. The remaining cranial nerves appeared to be normal. The patient denied any issues with sphincter control, and her cerebellar function was intact. Motor and sensory functions, aside from the aforemen - tioned areas, were completely normal. Her sense of taste was unaffected, and when touching the left side of her tongue, including pain perception, she reported a numb sensation. Chapter 10.  Numbness of Face and Tongue 65","Based on the clear objective and subjective sensory symp - toms pointing to the trigeminal nerve and brainstem involve - ment, further investigations were warranted. It is important to note that the sense of taste is primarily provided by the seventh cranial nerve (chorda tympani) in the anterior two- thirds of the tongue, while the posterior third is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (ninth cranial nerve). Light touch and pain sensation, on the other hand, are mediated by the lingual nerve, which is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3). The lingual nerve also contains fibres from the chorda tym - pani, suggesting a more central problem within the trigeminal nuclei rather than the cranial nerves themselves. Given the patient’s symptoms occurring after a severe chest infection, a vascular aetiology such as stroke should be considered. However, an inflammatory autoimmune process is also a possibility. The relatively minimal neurological dam - age (well-localized symptoms), and the ongoing improve - ment observed were not suggestive of an infectious cause such as meningitis or encephalitis. Trigeminal neurovascular conflict is unlikely in this case, as it typically presents with neuralgic pain rather than negative sensory symptoms (numbness) described by the patient.

In order to further investigate the underlying cause, a lumbar puncture (LP) was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed an increase in  lymphocytes (12 white blood cells) and a minimally raised protein level of 0.6  g/L.  Viral and bacterial PCR tests came back normal, and oligoclonal bands (OCB) were negative. Aquaporine-4 and anti-MOG antibodies were negative.

Follow-up MRI performed after 6  weeks showed nearly complete resolution of the observed changes, and the patient achieved a full clinical recovery without requiring treatment. The clinical diagnosis was determined as a parainfectious neurological syndrome, possibly Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM).

Subsequent MRI scans demonstrated a partially cystic, partially solid suprasellar mass (Figs.  11.2 and 11.3) with enhancing margins (Fig.  11.4), most likely indicating a suprasellar tumor, potentially a craniopharyngioma. Serum prolactin levels were found to be significantly increased at 2537 mU/L (normal range: 0–500 mU/L), indi - cating hyperprolactinemia. Additionally, low levels of lutein - izing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and cortisol were observed, suggestive of panhypopituitarism. These imaging findings were further supported by a biopsy/surgery, which confirmed the diagnosis of a craniopha - ryngioma.

It is commonly associated with pituitary lesions or neoplasm, which is consistent with the find - ings in this case. The observed visual field loss is a result of the compression or involvement of the optic chiasm by the tumour. The results of the biochemical blood tests, specifically the endocrine work-up, efficiently indicated a pituitary gland problem in this case. The increased serum prolactin levels, along with the low levels of LH and FSH, were consistent with hyperprolactinemia and panhypopituitarism, respec - tively. This pattern of biochemical findings can be explained by “stalk effect” when tumour compresses not only pituitary gland itself but also compresses the stalk limiting regulation of prolactin production. It is worth noting that the patient appeared asymptomatic in other aspects, with no signs of galactorrhea or other associ - ated symptoms typically associated with hyperprolactinemia.

The patient also had a history of chronic kidney disease and hypertension. At the time of admission, the patient was taking multiple medications, including Amisulpride 100 mg twice daily, Bisacodyl, Carbamazepine, Gabapentin, Lactulose, Lithium Carbonate, and Phenelzine. Over the past three to four months, he had experienced as many as 30–40 falls, all occurring when he attempted to mobilize without assistance from caregivers. The patient received care four times daily and was usually able to move with the aid of a walking frame.Upon admission, the patient was found to be hemodynami-cally stable and afebrile, with a normal systemic examination. However, on neurology examination, we found (likely long-standing) paraparesis with increased reflexes and muscle tone, and positive plantar reflexes.

He specifically mentioned that his thighs and hips felt weaker compared to his ankles.During the objective examination, his cerebellar functions (finger-nose test) and cranial nerves were normal. However, he exhibited obvious gait ataxia. There was widespread absence of reflexes (areflexia). The patient experienced sig-nificant allodynia (pain to non-painful stimuli) in his legs and had absent vibration sense in both ankles. Light touch and pinprick were reduced in legs. Muscle strength was normal in his arms and hands, but reduced in his legs. There were no signs of muscle atrophy. The patient reported his pain level as 10 out of 10, and opiates were needed to control it. Creatine kinase levels (CK) were normal.

These episodes were frequent, occurring daily. A week before his examina-tion, his symptoms suddenly re-appeared and this time remained present. At that point, he was seen at the A&E, and a CT head scan was performed, which showed normal findings.During his review by the neurologist (week after A&E visit), right arm weakness (3–4/5) was observed, with prona-tor drift and weakness extending into his wrist and elbow, along with very minimally preserved flexion and extension in his fingers (2/5). Muscle tone in right hand was reduced. Additionally, there was a light touch sensory deficit in his right arm and hand. Reflexes were symmetrical in arms and legs, with negative plantars. His cranial nerves and cerebellar functions were normal, and no sphincter symptoms were observed.Chapter 14Waxing and Waning Hand Weakness 94","Given the patient’s symptoms and cardiac history, a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) may be suspected as a possible aetiology for the waxing and waning nature of his symptoms, including sudden weakness or loss of function on one side of the body, particularly involving the arm and hand.

Differential diagnoses should also involve inflammation or a pathological process of the muscle—myopathy or myositis. There was no muscle pain (myalgia). Elevated ALT could also point to a muscle problem. Swallowing issues can be present in both above conditions. Cord process/cervical myelopathy would not explain bul - bar issues, and objective examination was not suggestive of corticospinal tract involvement (e.g., reduced/absent reflexes, negative plantars, normal tone). Bloods were sent for CK levels, vasculitis and autoimmune screen. Nerve conduction studies and EMG were requested. After discussion with a muscle specialist, an MRI of thighs was also requested (Fig.  17 .1).

The needle EMG revealed membrane instability in the deltoid, biceps, and tibialis ante - rior muscles with myopathic motor unit potentials. Proximal muscles were predominantly affected. Given the high CK levels, myositis was suspected. On MRI of the thighs, there was diffuse hyperintensity seen on T1 TIRM (Turbo inversion recovery magnitude) (Fig.  17 .1) and T2 FS (fat saturation) sequences, predominantly affecting the adductor muscles bilaterally with more prominent involve - ment on the left side. These findings were consistent with myositis. A muscle biopsy of the left vastus lateralis showed marked variation in fiber size (some fibers hypertrophic and others atrophic), and evidence of fiber necrosis. The biopsy conclusion was inflammatory myopathy, specifically polymy - ositis, with no signs supporting inclusion body myositis or dermatomyositis. The patient was started on steroids with significant clinical improvement and normalization of ALT and CK. Long-term stability was achieved on methotrexate.

Although MND was considered in the differential diagnosis, the duration of symptoms, lack of muscle atrophy, and proximal distribution of weakness were not suggestive of this diagnosis. The presence of Anti-Ro antibodies is signifi - cant, as they belong to myositis-associated autoantibodies (MAA).

The patient had been com-plaining to her daughter about blurred vision in her right eye and seemed progressively drowsy throughout that day.Upon admission, the patient was confused and disori-ented, stating the wrong year and mentioning that her little daughter was being looked after by grandparents despite her adult daughter being present in the room. The daughter also observed what she called facial droop on the right side of the patient’s face. The admitting physician reported right-sided facial droop, slurred speech, and moderate left-sided weak-ness in the hemi-distribution.The patient had no history of drug or alcohol use and no witnessed seizure activity. She was otherwise healthy and a non-smoker. It should be noted that the patient had a history of right eye amblyopia and squint in childhood. CK and rou-tine blood tests including FBC, ethanol, LFTs, and lactate were all normal. An ECG was also normal. A CT scan of the head was unremarkable. Neurology was consulted for further evaluation.Upon objective examination, the patient exhibited mild left-sided hemiparesis (according to the daughter, it appeared to have improved since admission).

Clinically, she exhibited right-sided third nerve palsy (incomplete but there is a history of a squint) and left-sided hemiparesis, which was already showing signs of improvement. These findings may suggest lesion at the level of the brainstem, specifically the third nerve motor nucleus, and also the Edinger-Westphal nucleus responsible for the pupillary light reflex (midbrain involvement). However, the presence of cognitive impair - ment indicates possible cortical involvement. The improvement of hemiparesis raises the possibility of Todd’s paralysis following an epileptic seizure, with the con - fusion being post-ictal in nature. However no seizure activity was reported and CK and lactate levels were normal. The lack of diplopia despite visible EOM impairment can be explained by pre-existing amblyopia. Infectious encephalitis or meningitis should be considered as an obvious possibility on the differential diagnoses list. Other pathological processes in the brainstem or supratento - rial region, such as neoplasms, should also be suspected. A CT scan of the head was unremarkable, making stroke less likely given the presence of prodromal symptoms and the patient’s lack of risk factors.

Up to 12% of patients with unilateral thalamic strokes can present with third nerve palsy on the ipsilateral side or isolated mydriasis can be found in case of medial tha - lamic lesions on the ipsilateral side. Clinical findings (despite preserved convergence and denied diplopia – likely due to a previous squint) are consistent with a right thalamic stroke. The patient’s congenital squint contributed to complex clini - cal findings. A right thalamic stroke can explain the left-sided hemiparesis and sensory deficit. Thalamic involvement in cognition can explain the patient’s confusion.,

She had a history of mild learning dif-ficulties related to foetal valproate syndrome, and there was a strong family history of epilepsy, with her mother, father, and two cousins all suffering from epilepsy. The patient had experienced febrile convulsions in childhood.The recent two seizures had occurred within 48  hours in the context of a severe viral infection, accompanied by symp-toms of nausea, vomiting, and high fever. She was reviewed more than 24 hours after the second seizure. At that time she had been afebrile for 24 hours and had subjectively felt much better. Patient had very poor recollection of the events sur-rounding the seizures, and according to her mother, she had been found unconscious in bed with some evidence of seizure activity (for about 1 min). There had been no evidence of bit-ten tongue or incontinence, and the patient had seemed tired and had wanted to rest after regaining consciousness. The mother had not reported any significant post-ictal phase.Blood tests at the time of admission were normal.On objective examination, all findings had been normal. The patient had expressed some reluctance to initiate antiepi-leptic drug (AED) therapy and had requested neurology opinion.Chapter 19T wo Seizures and Strong Family History of Epilepsy 124","The case involves a young woman who had a family history of epilepsy and learning difficulties, which put her at a higher risk of experiencing seizures. Her past history of febrile convulsions was also notable. The seizures she experienced were triggered by a severe viral gastroenteritis that caused a limited oral intake which may have resulted in hypoglycemia and dehydration. The patient was understandably anxious about the diagno - sis of epilepsy due to the associated stigma within her family. However, since she had more than one seizure and the sei - zures occurred more than 24 hours apart, she met the criteria Chapter 19.  Two Seizures and Strong Family History… 125 for epilepsy.

The episodes hap-pened without any prodrome, aura, significant headache or visual phenomena. Both times, it occurred (about 2 months apart) in the context of a viral infection. The first time she had diarrhoea and vomiting and the second time she had an upper respiratory viral illness. The sensory disturbance was limited to her left upper and lower limbs, possibly also involv-ing her torso. There was no motor involvement, nor was there any cranial nerve or facial involvement. The symptoms per-sisted for up to 10 days on each occasion. She had recently started taking the combined oral contraceptive for period control (irregular periods). The patient was seen 4  weeks after the last episode. Initial diagnosis offered to patient was functional hemisensory syndrome.During the objective examination, no pathology was detected.

Although the majority of similar cases are benign, there are some interesting points in the his - tory. First, the anatomical distribution of the sensory distur - bance is noteworthy.

In the strict sense, a sensory hemisyndrome describes sensory disturbance involving half of the body, including the face. However, in this case, the face was spared, Chapter 22.  Only Sensory Symptoms 145 suggesting a focal lesion in the unilateral spinothalamic tracts, likely below the trigeminal sensory nuclei (facial sparing). It is also important to remember that sensory fibres from the body cross the midline, so damage to the tract causes contra - lateral symptoms, but this is not valid for the trigeminal path - way, which causes ipsilateral symptoms. An MRI of the brain was arranged to investigate this further. Additionally, the fact that the patient’s symptoms occurred during severe infection may hint at an autoimmune or vascular process. While a sen - sory hemisyndrome can be present in complicated migraines, the lack of migraine history and infectious context in this case is unusual (Figs.  22.1 and 22.2).

The absence of facial involvement in this case was an impor - tant factor which pointed toward brainstem and area below trigeminal nuclei. The anterolateral spinal and medullar pathways, including the spinothalamic tract, are responsible for conveying sensory information related to pain, temperature, and crude touch. These pathways are topographically segregated, with the dor - sal part responsible for temperature, the middle part for pain, and the anterior part for touch.

The patient was offered surgery but declined; however, his clinical presentation remained stable over the long-term.Answers 152 Keywords  Sensory dysfunction · Thermoception deficit Cervical myelopathy","This case was interesting as it presented with sensory deficit in one limb only, along with some signs of motor issues (asymmetry in reflexes contralateral to the sensory deficit, and bilaterally positive plantar reflexes). The lack of bladder issues was misleading in this case. Therefore, it seemed likely that both the corticospinal tract and spinothalamic tract were involved. Interpreting the symmetrical reduction in vibration sense was difficult as it could be indicative of dorsal column involvement or age-related sensory deficit (element of sensory neuropathy). Changes in patient’s spine were likely chronic and it is also noteworthy that his condition remained stable even without surgery.","Rhee J, Tetreault LA, Chapman JR, et  al.

24.pdf,"A 30-year-old woman with a history of fibromyalgia pre-sented with a 2-day history of pins and needles and numbness in both feet. She described the sensation as if she had slept awkwardly and compressed her feet and they now feel “dead” . By day three, the sensation had spread up her legs, affecting the left leg much more than the right and also affecting her saddle area (reduced sensation). Gradually, the sensation changed to an unpleasant, “overtly sensitive feeling” on touch, and she experienced pain. At this point, she was also having difficulty walking, with poor balance. Blood tests were normal, and she tested negative for HIV . Her thyroid func-tion, hematinics (folate, B12), HbA1C and electrolytes (Calcium, Magnesium, and Phosphate) were normal.During the examination, the patient demonstrated increased reflexes in the legs, particularly on the left side. Positive plantar reflexes were noted on the left side. Bilaterally, there was a loss of vibration sense in the ankles. The patient experienced significant allodynia (painful response to touch) throughout the left leg, extending upwards towards the epi-gastric area (midway between the nipples and navel) and up to the mid-shins on the right side. Gait ataxia and a broad- based gait were observed. The patient reported recent consti-pation, but her bladder function was normal. No convincing Chapter 24Only Sensory Symptoms III 154 abnormalities were detected in the cranial nerves or cerebel - lar function. Upon sofa testing, muscle strength was margin - ally decreased in the left leg. Chapter 24.  Only Sensory Symptoms III 155","The patient displayed a relatively convincing sensory deficit and allodynia in a well-defined area extending from approxi - mately the T6 dermatome on the left side down to the left leg and affecting also right leg and foot. The gait ataxia was likely related to the sensory deficit (sensory ataxia). The ascending nature of the symptoms over the period of one week is par - ticularly noteworthy and raises the possibility of an inflam - matory neuropathy such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Normal bladder function (questionable constipation) may also be indicative of this condition. On the other hand, the increased reflexes, positive plan - tars, and convincing sensory level suggest possible cord pathology, specifically in the thoracic segments. Imaging of the spinal cord would be necessary to rule out the presence of a lesion in the spinal canal. The patient’s inflammatory markers were not elevated, making an infectious aetiology unlikely. A CSF analysis would also be required to investigate for autoimmune or infectious inflammation. Considering the patient’s demographics (age, sex), demy - elination/autoimmune inflammation such as multiple sclero - sis (MS) or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD) should also be considered. Given the convincing anatomical distribution of symptoms, a functional aetiology such as fibro - myalgia is unlikely (Figs.  24.1 and 24.2).Thoughts 156 F/i.sc/g.sc/u.sc/r.sc/e.sc /two.taboldstyle(.)

Interestingly, the patient’s CSF analysis returned normal results, including PCR, but oligoclonal bands were positive. The patient tested negative for Aquaporin 4 antibodies and anti-MOG antibodies. The patient responded well to high-dose steroids and subsequent MRI of the brain later confirmed the diagnosis of MS (fulfilling McDonald criteria), for which she was started on disease-  modifying therapy. Keywords  Ascending sensory symptoms · Allodynia Myelitis · Multiple sclerosisAnswers 158","This case underscores the importance of distinguishing between upper and lower motor neuron pathology on objec - tive examination, as well as recognizing (ruling out) other demyelinating disorders such as NMOSD and anti-MOG illnesses which can present with similar symptoms (cord involvement) but may require different treatment approaches. It is also important to note that not every cord lesion ini - tially presents with sphincter and motor symptoms.

25.pdf,"A 72-year-old woman was referred to neurology due to a six- week history of double vision. Additionally, over the last couple of weeks, she has experienced pain behind her right eye, with associated painful eye movements and right eyelid swelling. The patient also reported weight loss of 6 kg in the last 3 months, as well as heavier breathing even at rest. Blood tests revealed microcytic anemia, but thyroid function was normal. The patient had a previous history of breast cancer, but she had been in long-term remission for over 10  years. Upon admission, a chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions.Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities in the cerebellar, sensory or motor functions. However, the patient had right eye incomplete ophthalmoplegia with only preserved vertical up gaze and right sided ptosis (right eyelid was swollen). The right eyeball was also found to be painful on pressure. Interestingly, there was no involvement of the pupil and fundoscopy was normal bilaterally.Chapter 25New Double Vision and Cancer History 160 Chapter 25.  New Double Vision and Cancer History 161","We saw a patient who had some neurological signs, but there were collateral factors in the history that were noteworthy. There was previous breast cancer in long-term remission, but current breathlessness, pleural effusion, and swollen perior - bital tissue raised suspicion of neoplasm. From a neurological point of view, this could have been a case of painful ophthalmoplegia (Tolosa Hunt syndrome). As the pupil seemed normal and based on the eye mobility impairment, it did not seem that the third nerve was affected. Other than neoplastic processes, conditions that can affect the orbits and periorbital region such as sarcoidosis, orbital arteriovenous fistula, or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis should also be on the differential diagnostic list. Similar find - ings but rather with exophthalmos can be related to Graves disease, but normal thyroid tests are not suggestive of that, and we would expect bilateral/symmetrical changes. MRI scan of the orbits was requested and pleural effusion biopsy was arranged (Figs.  25.1 and 25.2).Thoughts 162 F/i.sc/g.sc/u.sc/r.sc/e.sc /two.taboldstyle(.)
